## 🌟 Project Overview

Every accident tells a story. Through this project, we aim to decode these stories by analyzing traffic accident data. Our goals include:

- 🛣️ Understanding how **road conditions** impact accidents.
- 🌧️ Exploring the effects of **weather** on accident frequency.
- ⏰ Identifying accident trends by **time of day**.
- 📍 Visualizing **hotspots** where accidents are most frequent.
- 🔍 Revealing the hidden **contributing factors** behind traffic mishaps.
